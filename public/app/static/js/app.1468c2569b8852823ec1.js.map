This seeks to reduce: </p>\n\n\n    <ul class=\"list\">\n\n        <li>The emissions of gases that cause the increase of the greenhouse effect in our atmosphere.</li>\n\n        <li> The consumption of fossil fuels (non-renewable resources). </li>\n\n        <li> Traffic congestions that cause great loss of time. </li>\n\n        <li>The levels of smoke and noise in the cities, causing diseases. </li>\n\n        <li> The probability of traffic accidents, with the consequent decrease in mortality. </li>\n\n    </ul>\n\n\n\n    <p><li> The probability of traffic accidents, with the consequent decrease in mortality. </li>...\n\n\n\n    <h2 id=\"lessgomas\">How does lessgo impact our lives?</h2>\n\n    <p>\n        When a person carpoolea occur several simultaneous events that affect the life of that person and that of others.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n        First, one of the biggest positive impacts of lessgo is to reinforce social ties. When sharing a trip, people who often did not know each other, generate a link through the talks of the trip. Emerging possibilities of work and new contacts, exchanging points of view on different topics, generating trust among the people, forming even a feeling of \"LessGo community\". This is achieving a cultural change in front of strangers, in addition to much more entertaining and fun trips.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n        Secondly, the practice of carpooling generates a positive environmental impact when two car drivers who usually travel in separate cars decide to join and travel in the same vehicle leaving the other stored in the garage. If this becomes habitual in people we could reduce the amount of circulating cars and thus also decrease travel time, emissions of greenhouse gases, the consumption of fossil fuels (non-renewable resources), smog and noise pollution that provoke vehicles, among other benefits.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      Most of the trips that are currently loaded on the platform do not generate a direct environmental impact. These are interurban trips that are occasionally made on weekends. However, they are useful for people to know the practice, they are encouraged to travel with strangers and find a new way of traveling. In the future, when the practice becomes massive, we hope that people will consider carpooling as something viable to apply both to their occasional weekend trips as well as to routine ones, going to work, school, etc. . We also hope that more drivers will let themselves be carried by someone else's car and leave theirs saved.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n        Most of the trips that are currently loaded on the platform do not generate a direct environmental impact.

That is why we believe it is important to encourage this practice and to make people aware so they can make more rational use of the car.\n    </p>\n\n\n\n    <h2>Environmental impact</h2>\n\n    <p>\n        Each time two motorists decide to share the trip in a single vehicle, the emission of 150 g of CO <sub> 2 </sub> into the atmosphere, one of the main gases that contribute to the atmosphere, is avoided - on average, per kilometer traveled. to the greenhouse effect, and the consumption of 0.071 liters of naphtha, a non-renewable source of energy and that is why it must be used rationally.\n    </p>\n\n\n\n    <h2>Awards</h2>\n\n    <ul class=\"list\">\n\n        <li> Soon ...</li>\n\n\n    </ul>\n    <div aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"cursor: default;\">_____________________________</div>\n\n\n\n\n  </div>\n</template>\n<style scoped>\n    .about-page {\n        background: white;\n        border-radius: 8px;\n        box-shadow: 0 0 5px 6px #CCC;\n        margin: 3em auto;\n        padding: 2em;\n    }\n    @media (max-width: 767px) {\n        .about-page {\n            box-shadow: none;\n            margin: 0 auto;\n        }\n    }\n    h1 {\n        color: #E0191C;\n    }\n    .list {\n        color: #555555;\n        list-style-type: circle;\n        padding-left: 40px;\n    }\n    h2 {\n        color: #016386;\n    }\n    .img-ES {\n        max-width: 100%;\n    }\n</style>\n\n\n<script>\nimport bus from '../../services/bus-event.js';\n\nexport default {\n    name: 'about',\n    data () {\n        return {\n        };\n    },\n    mounted () {\n        bus.on('back-click', this.onBackClick);\n    },\n\n    beforeDestroy () {\n        bus.off('back-click', this.onBackClick);\n    },\n\n    methods: {\n        onBackClick () {\n            this.$router.back();\n        }\n    }\n};\n</script>\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// About.vue?56f7be7e","<template>\n\n</template>\n\n<script>\nimport { mapActions } from 'vuex';\n\nexport default {\n    name: 'activate',\n    props: ['token'],\n\n    data () {\n        return {\n\n        };\n    },\n\n    methods: {\n        ...mapActions({\n            activateAccount: 'auth/activate'\n        })\n    },\n\n    mounted () {\n        this.activateAccount(this.token);\n    }\n};\n</script>\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// Activate.vue?072d0a46","<template>\n    <div class=\"bubblecontainer\">\n        <div id=\"bubble\" v-bind:style=\"{ 'background-image': 'url(' + image + ')'}\">\n        </div>\n        <p style=\"color: black;text-align:center;padding:0;margin:0;margin-top:7px\">{{title}}</p>\n    </div>\n</template>\n<style scoped>\n    .bubblecontainer {\n        /* border: solid black 1px;

As such, actual or unfulfilled fulfillment of the trip proposed by the driver and accepted by the passenger can not hold the LessGo responsible. Nor will LessGo be responsible for the travel conditions agreed between the users, in any way whatsoever: the service provided by LessGo through the site is only as a means of contact.\n            LessGo does not assume the realization, ownership, or responsibility of the provision of the services that it intermediates, neither in front of the users of the same, nor in front of third parties.\n        </p>\n        <h2>Automobile insurance</h2>\n        <p>\n          Before the User proposes a trip as a driver, he must first verify that the validity of his motor insurance covers the entire duration of the trip. The traffic law indicates as a requirement to circulate with a motor vehicle that carries the valid proof of insurance. An uninsured driver is fully responsible for the damages caused to his passengers in the event of an accident. LessGo is not responsible for checking if the user has auto insurance or if the insurance will be valid for the entire duration of the trip; The previous verification is the responsibility of the users of the site, both driver and passengers of the trip.\n            Users are informed that insurance companies may refuse to cover any damage incurred during a trip during which the driver would have asked passengers for a greater economic participation than that established by the travel expenses division. Because, when requesting an economic participation greater than that established, the insurance for private cars associated with the vehicle with which the shared trip was made could be invalidated.\n            LessGo has no responsibility in defining travel expenses or how expenses are divided among the participants of the trip. It is the responsibility of the participants of the trip, both passengers and driver, that the economic participation is not greater than that established by the division of travel expenses to maintain the validity of the insurance associated with the vehicle with which the shared trip was made.\n        </p>\n        <h2>Interruptions and failures of the service</h2>\n        <p>\n          LessGo intends to offer the service in an uninterrupted manner.
